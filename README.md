# TeaLeaf.jl

This is a port of [TeaLeaf](https://github.com/UK-MAC/TeaLeaf) to the [Julia Programming Language](https://julialang.org/).
It was ported from [this C implementation](https://github.com/UoB-HPC/TeaLeaf) of TeaLeaf.
See [the issues tab](https://github.com/Laura7089/TeaLeaf.jl/issues) for an idea of the status of the project.

## Usage

The code is intended to use the same configuration file format as other TeaLeaf implementations; an example configuration fileset (`tea.in`, `tea.problems`) is provided.

### Running

#### Using `just`

Using [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) is the recommended way to run the program.

`just run` will run the program with the default parameters.
To see more options, see the output of `just -l`.
